# Tic Tac Toe 

This repository contains Python code for the game Tic Tac Toe, developed as part of a university assignment.

## Code Description

The code in this repository implements the game Tic Tac Toe, where two players take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The players aim to create a row, column, or diagonal of their respective marks to win the game. The code uses a command-line interface to display the game board and accept player input.

The `main()` function initializes the game and alternates the turns between players until the game is over. The `TicTacToe` class represents the game board and contains methods for player input, displaying the board, checking for a win, and more.
